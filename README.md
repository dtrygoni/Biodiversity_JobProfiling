# Biodiversity_JobProfiling
R code for the paper "A Framework for Profiling the Job Requirements for a Career in Software Engineering."

The dataset used for the results in the paper cannot be shared due to licensing restrictions. However, we provide a sample dataset that includes the four Software Engineering roles analyzed, along with the corresponding values for the "Month" (Time) column.

The analysis requires a binary representation indicating the presence or absence of each skill. Additionally, the first two columns of the dataset represent the Role and the Month of each sample, respectively.
